Team 6621
Sponsorship Information Packet

Captain’s Letter:
Dear Future Sponsor, 

The Chatham High School robotics team, Artemis 6621, hopes that you will support us during this year’s FIRST Robotics Competition Season.

Chatham is a small rural school in Columbia County with over 42% on the free-reduced lunch program. We have declining student populations and currently have fewer than 90 students per class. Our team is small, but scrappy. Since rebuilding after COVID 
we have helped to establish a FIRST Tech Challenge team in our middle school and a Lego League Challenge program at the Morris Memorial Center. We currently have over 20 participants on the team and anticipate the program growing over the coming years. 

Our team stands apart from other teams in our region:

We are the only team in Columbia County, we refuse to charge students to participate; including meals, shirts, and travel expenses. We are a small team in an area with limited tech industries and yet rely on community sponsors to help us. 

We need your support to help us continue this program and to expand to encompass students in grades K-12. All funds raised through grants and sponsorships are used to cover supplies, tools, travel and meals at competitions, and uniforms. 

For more information, please visit our website at https://sites.google.com/chatham.k12.ny.us/fischer/artemis-robotics?authuser=0 or email us at fischers@chatham.k12.ny.us.

Sincerely, 

Reed Fisch
2026 Captain 

About FRC:
The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a global high school robotics program that challenges students to design, build, and program large, functional robots to complete specific tasks in a game-like setting. FRC combines science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to foster critical thinking, collaboration, and innovation.

Our team, Artemis (Team 6621), takes part in this exciting program and will be competing at the Hudson Valley Regional and the Tech Valley Regional this year. Last year we were on the winning alliance at the Tech Valley Regional and went on to compete at the World Championship in Houston, TX! You can find out more about FRC on the official First website.

By supporting us, you’re investing in the future of STEM education and helping our team achieve success both on and off the field.

We are Artemis 6621. Our team is based at Chatham High School in New York and was founded in 2017 by student Ben Ripple and our mentors, Mr. and Mrs. Fischer.

We are a small school with fewer than 90 students per graduating class. As a result, we have limited resources, members, and opportunities compared to larger teams from big schools. Your sponsorship is essential to helping us grow, compete, and succeed alongside these bigger teams.

In 2024, our team earned the Creativity Award, while our Captain, Eion Henchey, was recognized as a Dean’s List Finalist, and our Safety Captain, Reed Fisch, received the Safety Captain Award.

Last season we won the Tech Valley Regional taking us to the World Championship in Houston, TX. At worlds we led our alliance to the highest scoring match in our division. And narrowly lost to the alliance that ended up winning our division.

As we enter this season, we are committed to carrying this momentum forward for our students and community as we plan on returning to Worlds.
About our team:

Objectives:
Support and encourage our FTC team
The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is another robotics program by FIRST, where smaller teams create smaller robots to compete in strategic games. FTC serves as an excellent stepping stone to FRC which is why we started a team for our middle schoolers.
Make it to the Playoffs again
And ideally… Win
Purchase a laser-cutter
This is a must have for prototyping
Attend Worlds (FIRST Championship)
Worlds is THE robotics competition. More than 600 teams worldwide attend. It is hosted in Houston, Texas. 
The entry cost is $5,750. This price does not include transportation and hotel costs.
Build knowledge with new team 
members
Do more demonstrations for the 
community
